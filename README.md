# Exploring TensorFlow Lite for Embedded Systems

This project involved implementing and evaluating various machine learning models using TensorFlow Lite for embedded systems.

## Objectives

- Explore capabilities of deploying ML models on resource-constrained embedded devices using TFLite
- Optimize models for high accuracy with low latency and memory usage
- Evaluate performance to determine viability of edge AI applications

## Tasks Implemented

The following models were developed and tested using TensorFlow Lite:

- Image Classification on CIFAR-10 dataset
- Gesture Recognition using a custom gesture dataset
- Handwritten Digit Classification on MNIST dataset

For each task, the TensorFlow model was first trained on a GPU machine. The model was then converted to a TFLite model and optimized for deployment on an embedded system.

## Methodology

- Dataset preprocessing and augmentation
- Neural network model design and training
- Conversion to optimized TFLite model
- Performance evaluation for accuracy, latency and memory footprint
